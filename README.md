Single Page HTML Resume

Overview
This project is a single-page HTML resume, created as part of a learning journey to master front-end development skills. It covers fundamental HTML concepts, building a clean and structured resume layout, and preparing for future CSS styling.

Project Description
This HTML resume was built following a roadmap exercise, with some additional tweaks to add a personal challenge for the CSS phase. The resume includes structured sections such as Skills, Education, Experience, and Social Media links, using semantic HTML tags and proper formatting.

Learning Process
Creating this resume felt intuitive, and I learned HTML quickly. Here’s how I approached the project:

Reference Resources: I used an image as a reference and allowed myself to make a few modifications for added CSS challenges in the future.

Learning Tools: I frequently consulted MDN and W3Schools to verify syntax for tags I wasn’t fully comfortable with.

Productivity Tips: Music helped keep my energy high—I was singing and dancing while coding, which made the process even more enjoyable!

Challenges and Solutions
Syntax Checks: I used ChatGPT for quick syntax verification and troubleshooting. For further validation, I referenced MDN and W3Schools to ensure all tags were used correctly.

Next Steps
I’m excited to move on to CSS styling. This will allow me to bring the design to life and implement more advanced formatting and layout concepts.
